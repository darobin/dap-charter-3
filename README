This is a draft proposed charter for the third iteration on DAP.

It includes the following changes:

    • Bluetooth API
    • QR Codes API
    • Application Store API
    • Removed system beep
    • Removed reading the current volume
    • Removed requesting generic permission
    • Remove privacy mechanism

Nothing in here is definitive or committed to, and all is up for discussion.
